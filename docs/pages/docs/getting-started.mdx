# Getting started with Turborepo

Turborepo is a build system for JavaScript/TypeScript monorepos: codebases containing multiple projects, often using multiple frameworks, in a single unified code repository. You can adopt Turborepo to your project incrementally to gain the benefits of Turborepo at your own pace.

Turborepo is designed to integrate incrementally into new and existing projects. To create a new monorepo, you can get started with:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```
You can also clone a Turborepo starter repository to get a head start on your project. To see Turborepo examples and starter, see the [Turborepo examples directory on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/blob/main/examples).

## Add Turborepo to your existing monorepo

`turbo` works with [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/), [npm](https://npmjs.com), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) on the following operating systems:

- macOS darwin 64-bit (Intel), ARM 64-bit (Apple Silicon)
- Linux 32-bit, 64-bit, ARM, ARM 64-bit, MIPS 64-bit Little Endian, PowerPC 64-bit Little Endian, IBM Z 64-bit Big Endian
- Windows 32-bit, 64-bit, ARM 64-bit
- FreeBSD 64-bit, ARM 64-bit
- NetBSD AMD64
- Android ARM 64-bit

## Configure workspaces

`turbo` is built on top of Workspaces,  way of managing multiple packages from within a single root package. Turborepo is compatible with the workspace implementations from all package managers. For more information on managing your Turborepo workspaces, see the [Workspaces](./core-concepts/workspaces) documentation.

You can configure workspaces whatever way you want, but a common example folder structure is keeping applications in the `/apps` folder and packages in the `/packages` folder. The configuration of these folders is different for each package manager.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'Yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
<div/>
Specify your `workspaces` in your root `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
 "workspaces": [
   "packages/*",
   "apps/*"
  ]
}
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
<div/>
Specify your `workspaces` in your root `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
 "workspaces": [
   "packages/*",
   "apps/*"
  ]
}
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
<div/>
Specify your `packages` in `pnpm-workspaces.yaml`.
```yaml filename="pnpm-workspace.yaml"
packages:
  - "packages/*"
  - "apps/*"
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After configuring your workspaces, re-run your package manager's `install` command.

<Callout>
  Note: Nested workspaces are not supported. You can flatten your workspaces as a workaround.
</Callout>

## Install `turbo`

Add `turbo` as a development dependency in the root of your project.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install turbo -D
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add turbo -DW
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm add turbo -Dw
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The `turbo` package is a little shell that will install the proper `@turborepo/*` packages.

## Create `turbo.json`

In your root directory, create an empty file named `turbo.json`. This will hold the configuration for Turborepo in your project.

If your git repo's base branch is not `origin/master`, then you need to specify a `baseBranch` too. For example, `origin/main`.

```json filename="./turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "baseBranch": "origin/main"
}
```

## Create a `pipeline`

To define your project's task dependency graph, use the [`pipeline`](./features/pipelines) key in the `turbo.json` configuration file at the root of your project. `turbo` interprets this configuration and conventions to properly schedule, execute, and cache the outputs of the `package.json` scripts defined in all of your workspaces in your monorepo.

Each key in the [`pipeline`](./features/pipelines) object is the name of a `package.json` script that can be executed by [`turbo run`](./reference/command-line-reference#turbo-run-task1-task2-1). You can specify its dependencies with the [`dependsOn`](../reference/configuration#dependson) key beneath it as well as some other options related to [caching](./features/caching). For more information on configuring your pipeline, see the [`Pipelines`](./core-concepts/pipelines) documentation.

Packages that do not have have this script defined in their `package.json`'s list of `scripts` will be ignored and skipped over during `turbo run`.

```jsonc filename="./turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      // A package's `build` script depends on that package's
      // topological dependencies' and devDependencies'
      // `build` tasks  being completed first
      // (that's what the `^` symbol signifies).
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      // note: output globs are relative to each package's `package.json`
      // (and not the monorepo root)
      "outputs": [".next/**"]
    },
    "test": {
      // A package's `test` script depends on that package's
      // own `build` script being completed first.
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "outputs": [],
      // A package's `test` script should only be rerun when
      // either a `.tsx` or `.ts` file has changed in `src` or `test` folders.
      "inputs": ["src/**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.tsx"]
    },
    "lint": {
      // A package's `lint` script has no dependencies and
      // can be run whenever. It also has no filesystem outputs.
      "outputs": []
    },
    "deploy": {
      // A package's `deploy` script depends on the `build`,
      // `test`, and `lint` scripts of the same package
      // being completed. It also has no filesystem outputs.
      "dependsOn": ["build", "test", "lint"],
      "outputs": []
    }
  }
}
```

The rough execution order for a given package based on the `dependsOn` keys:

1. `build` once its dependencies have run their `build` commands
2. `test` once its _own_ `build` command is finished and has no filesystem outputs (just logs)
3. `lint` can run whenever and has no filesystem outputs (just logs)
4. `deploy` once its _own_ `build`, `test`, and `lint` commands have finished, no outputs

After execution, the full pipline can run:

```bash
npx turbo run build test lint deploy
```

Turborepo will then efficiently schedule execution minimizing idle CPUs.

## Edit `.gitignore`

Add `.turbo` to your `.gitignore` file. The CLI uses these folders for logs and certain task outputs.

```diff
+ .turbo
```

Make sure that your task artifacts, the files and folders you want cached, are also included in your `.gitignore`.

```diff
+ build/**
+ dist/**
+ .next/**
```

Re-run your npm client's install command to check your configuration.

## Create `package.json` scripts

Add or update `scripts` in your root `package.json` and have them delegate to `turbo`.

```jsonc filename="./package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo build",
    "test": "turbo test",
    "lint": "turbo lint",
    "dev": "turbo dev"
  }
}
```

## Build your monorepo

<Tabs items={['npm', 'Yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    yarn build
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    pnpm build
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Depending on your monorepo setup, some artifacts might already be caching properly. In the next sections, we'll show how `turbo` works, how `scope` works, and then how to get caching working after that.

## Configure Remote Caching <Beta/>

A major key ðŸ”‘ to Turborepo's speed is that it is both lazy and efficientâ€”it does the least amount of work possible and it tries to never redo work that's already been done before.
At the moment, Turborepo caches your tasks on your local filesystem (i.e. "single-player mode," if you will). However, what if there was a way to take advantage of the computational work done by your teammates or your CI (i.e. "co-op multiplayer mode")? What if there was a way to teleport and share a single cache across machines? Almost like a "Dropbox" for your Turborepo cache.

> Remote Caching has entered the chat.

Turborepo can use a technique known as Remote Caching to share cache artifacts across machines for an additional speed boost.

<Callout type="error">
  Remote Caching is a powerful feature of Turborepo, but with great power comes great responsibility. Make sure you are caching correctly first and double check handling of environment variables. Please also remember Turborepo treats logs as artifacts, so be aware of what you are printing to the console.
</Callout>

### Link your turborepo to your Remote Cache

Remote caching is available with zero configuration on [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=turborepo.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=docs-link).

### Using Remote Caching for Local development

If you want to link your local turborepo to your Remote Cache you can authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your Vercel account:

```sh
npx turbo login
```

Then, link your turborepo to your remote cache:

```
npx turbo link
```

Once enabled, make some changes to a package or application you are currently caching and run tasks against it with `turbo run`.
Your cache artifacts will now be stored locally and in your Remote Cache. To verify that this worked, delete your local Turborepo cache:

```sh
rm -rf ./node_modules/.cache/turbo
```

Run the same build again. If things are working properly, `turbo` should not execute tasks locally, but rather download both the logs and artifacts from your Remote Cache and replay them back to you.
